  4 August, 2016</time><p>Hello Kenner_, since it's your birthday I have decided to make a blogpost for you. It's been over a year since we met on the Overcast and all the moment we had together has been life changing. You introduced me to many new friends which got me more into the community. I am really grateful for that you have always been there for me which is awesome. We have always been kind to each other, never been angry against each other which is great and we have always been helpful to each other. It's really sad to see Overcast shut down because I still want to keep in touch with you because that would be great. Thanks for an awesome year. Have a great day. Kind regards from your best buddy Fanta. </p>
