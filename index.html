  <h3>Hello there! My name is Johannes but you can call me Fanta. I'm a 14 year old norwegian student, musician, climber, nerd and a freelance developer.</h3>
  <h3>I was born in Denmark on the 27th June 2002. And ever since I have been loving music, science, biology, climbing, training and computers.<p></p>
    </h3><h3>I got my first computer in 2007 by my mom and dad. Three years later I started playing an instrument which is a trombone. Two years later I started climbing. Three years later I got into one of my favorite hobbies right now which is of course programming.</h3> <h3>The first programming language I learned was html a markup language for websites. Later I got into css a cascading stylesheets for websites. Some months later I started learning java and c#. Right now I am working on my first videogame and I'm also taking courses in javascript and more advanced css.</h3>
    <h3>Right now I'm in 9th Grade. Having fun learning programming and science. If you wish to contact me, please use the contact section to contact me.
      </h3><h3>Have a nice day!</h3>
      <h3>- Fanta</h3>
